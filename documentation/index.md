Your project documentation will inevitably be [the most][rdd] [important part][most-important-doc] of your project going forward. It's important to use any and all means at your disposal to document your code. :gem: Include a lot of usage examples and keep it concise and clearly structured.

## Inline
Worry more about not documenting enough than documenting too much.

## Flowcharts
:green_apple: Flowcharts can convey overview in ways that is impossible to put into words. It can be a great way to organize e.g. a pipeline of functions that will help you in the design of your project.

A great, dedicated flow chart creation tool is :gift_heart: [Delineato][delineato], $6.99 on the *Mac App Store*. Another option that works surprisingly well is :gift_heart: [Apple Keynote][keynote] making use of the ``Insert > Line > [Straight] Connection Line``.
